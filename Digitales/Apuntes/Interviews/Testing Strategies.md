# Testing Strategies

## Functional vs Non-Functional

**Functional testing** is a [quality assurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance "Quality assurance") (QA) process and a type of [black-box testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing "Black-box testing") that bases its test cases on the specifications of the software component under test. Functions are tested by feeding them input and examining the output, and internal program structure is rarely considered (unlike [white-box testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing "White-box testing")). Functional testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional [requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement "Requirement"). Functional testing usually describes *what* the system does.

# Functional Testing Strategies

## Unit Testing

Unit testing ensures that each part of the code developed in a component delivers the desired output. In unit testing, developers only look at the interface and the specification for a component. It provides documentation of code development as each unit of the code is thoroughly tested standalone before progressing to another unit.

## Integration Testing

**Integration testing** is performed to test individual components to check how they function together. In other words, it is performed to test the modules which are working fine individually and do not show bugs when integrated. Usually automated.

## Regression Testing

**Regression testing** is re-running [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing "Functional testing") and [non-functional tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_testing "Non-functional testing") to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change

## Smoke Testing

Smoke testing is performed on the ‘new’ build given by developers to QA team to verify if the basic functionalities are working or not. In smoke testing, the test cases chosen cover the most important functionality or component of the system.
