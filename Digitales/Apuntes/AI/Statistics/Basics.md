# Variables

In statistics, a **variable** has two defining characteristics:

- A variable is an attribute that describes a person, place, thing, or idea.
- The value of the variable can "vary" from one entity to another.

## Qualitative vs. Quantitative Variables

Variables can be classified as **qualitative** (aka, categorical) or **quantitative** (aka, numeric).

- **Qualitative**. 

  Qualitative variables take on values that are names or labels. The color of a ball (e.g., red, green, blue) or the breed of a dog (e.g., collie, shepherd, terrier) would be examples of qualitative or categorical variables.

  - **Discrete**

    Discrete variables are usually associated with natural numbers. Example: amount of people in the planet. (There no thing as 1,5 people.)

  - **Continuous**

    Can take on any value between its minimum value and its maximum value. Example all real values between 1 to 10.

- **Quantitative** 

  â€‹	variables are numeric. They represent a measurable quantity. For example, when we speak of the population of a city, we are talking about the number of people in the city - a measurable attribute of the city. Therefore, population would be a quantitative variable.

# Data

## Univariate vs. Bivariate Data

- **Univariate data**. When we conduct a study that looks at only one variable, we say that we are working with univariate data. Suppose, for example, that we conducted a survey to estimate the average weight of high school students. Since we are only working with one variable (weight), we would be working with univariate data.
- **Bivariate data**. When we conduct a study that examines the relationship between two variables, we are working with bivariate data. Suppose we conducted a study to see if there were a relationship between the height and weight of high school students. Since we are working with two variables (height and weight), we would be working with bivariate data.

# Populations & Samples

The study of statistics revolves around the study of data sets. This lesson describes two important types of data sets - **populations** and **samples**. Along the way, we'll introduce simple random sampling, the main method used in this tutorial to select samples.

The main difference between a population and sample has to do with how observations are assigned to the data set.

- A **population** includes all of the [elements](https://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=element) from a set of data.
- A **sample** consists one or more observations drawn from the population.

Depending on the sampling method, a sample can have fewer observations than the population, the same number of observations, or more observations. More than one sample can be derived from the same population
